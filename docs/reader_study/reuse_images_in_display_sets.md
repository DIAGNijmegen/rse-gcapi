When creating display sets for a reader study, it is sometimes the case that images are being shown multiple times in different display sets.

Viewer applications such as CIRRUS need to **download each image** in the display set. If an image is correctly re-used in display sets the viewer can re-use a previous download. Re-using a download speeds up the case loading time.

#TODO add good example of how to upload, wait and then re-use the image.
