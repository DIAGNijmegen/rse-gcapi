## Features

This client library is a handy way to interact with the REST API for
grand-challenge.org from python, and provides some convenience methods.
Documentation and examples can be found on [Grand
Challenge](https://grand-challenge.org/documentation/grand-challenge-api/).

## Tests
This client is tested using the `tox` framework. This enables testing
the client in various python-version environments.

For example, running a specific `your_test` for only the python 3.6
environment can be done as follows:
```bash
tox -e py36 -- -k your_test
```
