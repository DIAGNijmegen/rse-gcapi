    <h1>Grand Challenges in Biomedical Image Analysis</h1>

    <p>Every year, thousands of papers are published that describe new
        algorithms
        to be applied to medical and biomedical images, and various new
        products appear on the market based on such algorithms. But few papers
        and products provide a fair and direct comparison of the newly proposed
        solution with the state-of-the-art. We believe that such comparisons
        can help the research community and industry to develop better
        algorithms. We support the organization of these comparative studies
        and the dissemination of their results.</p>

    <p>Organizing and participating in challenges is not the only way to
        facilitate
        better comparisons between new and existing solutions. If it were
        easy to publish and share your data, and the code you used to evaluate
        your algorithm's performance on that data, and possibly the algorithm
        itself, others could directly compare their approach to yours,
        using the same test data and the same evaluation metrics. With this
        site we provide tools to make it as easy as possible for you to publish
        your data and your evaluation for any paper you've written.</p>

    <p><a href="/Why_Challenges/">Why Challenges?</a> describes the rationale
        for organizing grand challenges, provides advice for those who
        want to organize such events, and discusses where we hope the
        field will move to next.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="{% url 'challenges:list' %}">All Challenges</a> provides an
        overview of
        all previous, ongoing and upcoming challenges in biomedical image
        analysis that we are aware of. Drop us a note if you want your
        event listed on this overview.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="/Create_your_own_challenge/">Create your own challenge</a>
        explains how you can set up your own challenge site in a matter of
        minutes.
    </p>

    <p>Grand challenges in medical image analysis would not be possible without
        the support and enthusiasm from all <a href="/Contributors/">contributors</a>.
